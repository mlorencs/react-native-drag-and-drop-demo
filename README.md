# React Native Drag & Drop using Pan Responders Demo

This project is just a demo how to implement drag & drop functionality into your React Native application using React Native's own PanResponder.

This project was bootstrapped with:

- [Expo CLI](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli).

Before running any scripts, make sure you have [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) installed on your machine and have installed all dependencies:

### `yarn` or `yarn install`

## Available Scripts

### Starting the development server

---

#### `expo start`

Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of this app using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.

### Opening the app on your phone/tablet

---

- üçé On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
- ü§ñ On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab of the Expo client app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.

### Alternative to opening the app on your phone/tablet

---

#### `expo start --ios`

Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, pops up Expo Dev Tools, and installs and launches the app on the iOS device/emulator.

#### `expo start --android`

Expo CLI starts Metro Bundlder, pops up Expo Dev Tools, and installs and launches the app on the Android device/emulator.

#### `expo start --web`

**Note: Starting in SDK 33 projects bootstrapped with the Expo CLI will have web support from the start. That means web apps can use the same code-base as your existing native app.**

Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, pops up Expo Dev Tools and launches the app on the web browser with Webpack.

### Ejecting from Managed Workflow

---

#### `expo eject`

This will download the required dependencies and build native projects under the `ios` and `android` directories.
